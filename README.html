<h1>MultiplEYE WG1: Experiment Implementation</h1>
<p>This repository contains the code for a MultiplEYE eye-tracking-while-reading experiment for multiple languages.
After you have read this README make sure to read the relevant files in the guidelines folder. There exists a MARKDOWN
and a HTML version of the guidelines. Both are exactly the same. You can read whatever format you prefer. Also for this README,
there exist two versions.</p>
<p>If you would like to contribute, please read the following guidelines: <a href="guidelines/html/CONTRIBUTING.html">CONTRIBUTING.html</a> and
contact <a href="mailto:multipleye@cl.uzh.ch">multipleye@cl.uzh.ch</a>.</p>
<p>In order to run the MultiplEYE experiment you will need to complete the following steps</p>
<ol>
<li>Please read the official MultiplEYE guidelines linked on this page: <a href="https://multipleye.eu/contribute/">MultiplEYE contribute</a></li>
<li>Following the guidelines, prepare the stimulus files which includes the creation of the images</li>
<li>Prepare the environment for the experiment following the guidelines in <a href="guidelines/html/CONDA_ENVIRONMENT.html">CONDA_ENVIRONMENT.html</a></li>
<li>Install the necessary packages for your eye-tracker. For EyeLink eye-trackers
<a href="guidelines/html/INSTALL_PYLINK.html">INSTALL_PYLINK.html</a>. For Tobii eye-trackers, please see <a href="#develop-and-run-experiments-for-tobii">develop for Tobii</a> further below.</li>

</ol>
<h2>Run the dummy experiment</h2>
<p>The experiment can be run in dummy mode which means that can be run without an actual eye-tracker.
If you'd like to run it, make sure you have completed the above steps, and you have your conda environment activated.</p>
<p>To be sure that you are running the dummy version, check the following things:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">conda activate multipleye3.9
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can navigate to the root folder of your local clone of the repository (your path should now end with
<code>wg1-experiment-implementation</code>. Run the following command to run the dummy experiment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">python experiment_implementation/start_multipleye_session.py
</code></pre>
<h2>Check the result files</h2>
<p>The experiment will write log and data files to a newly created results folder for your language and country
in the data folder (<code>data/eye_tracking_data...</code>).
In there it will create a folder depending on the experiment type. For example, if you run the test session,
it will create a folder called <code>test_dataset</code>. Within those
folders it will simply create a new folder for each participant. The folder name is the participant ID
(three-digit number). If you run the
script for the core dataset, it will prevent you from running the experiment twice for the same participant.
Note that if you run a test session, it will not warn you if you enter the same participant ID more than once. It will
just write the files to the same folder.</p>
<p>The naming scheme of the log files is a follows:
<code>[log_file_type]_[session_id]_[participant_id]_[date]_[timestamp].txt</code>.</p>
<p>All logfiles are csv files. Note that the timestamps are relative to the start of the experiment. The experiment starts
at timestamp 0.</p>
<h3>Run the experiment on macOS</h3>
<p>In order to run the experiment including the GUI on Mac you need to do the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li>You need to allow PsychoPy to access your input. In order to do that go to <code>System Preferences</code>
-&gt; <code>Security &amp; Privacy</code> -&gt; <code>Privacy</code> -&gt; <code>Input Monitoring</code>. Then you click on the '+' and add PsychoPy.
Pick the PsychoPy version that is in your env. For me the path for a anaconda env called 'test' looks like this:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-bash">/Users/[USERNAME]/opt/anaconda3/envs/multipleye3.9/bin/psychopy
</code></pre>
<h2>Run the experiment with an eye-tracker</h2>
<p>In order to run the experiment with an actual eye-tracker you need to adjust the following lines in
<a href="experiment_implementation/local_config.py"> <code>local_config.py</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">DUMMY_MODE = False
</code></pre>
<p>Depending on what eye-tracker you intend to use you need to install the software that comes with the eye-tracker. You
don't always need a license for that. E.g. for tobii trackers there is a free software available
<a href="https://www.tobii.com/products/software/applications-and-developer-kits/tobii-pro-eye-tracker-manager">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Develop and run experiments for EyeLink</h3>
<p>The code has been tested with EyeLink eye-trackers and mostly on a Windows presentation PC. However, MacOS should work
as well, but it has not been tested as thoroughly.
You will need to install <code>pylink</code> a package provided by SR Research if you use EyeLink eye-trackers.
Note that <code>pip install pylink</code> installs a different package although the names are the same! Step-by-step instructions
of how to install <code>pylink</code> can be found here: <a href="guidelines/html/INSTALL_PYLINK.html">INSTALL_PYLINK.html</a></p>
<h3>Develop and run experiments for Tobii</h3>
<p>An early version of the experiment has been tested with tobii eye-trackers. However, the code is not yet fully developed
and tested as the experiment as been developed further since then. If you want to use a tobii eye-tracker, you definitively
need to follow the following steps. Once those are completed, it will still be necessary to adjust the code in order to
work with the tobii eye-trackers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Tobii Pro SDK: <a href="https://connect.tobii.com/s/sdk-downloads?language=en_US">link</a></li>
<li>Download the SDK</li>
<li>Unzip the folder and copy all files from either the '32' or '64' folder to the experiment_implementation folder</li>
<li>Then you can pip install the package: <code>pip install tobii_research</code></li>
</ol>
<h3>Develop and run experiments for other eye-trackers</h3>
<p>Depending on what is needed we can add more eye-trackers. There is also a team that is trying to set up experiment
using a webcam. Please contact <a href="mailto:multipleye@cl.uzh.ch">multipleye@cl.uzh.ch</a> for more information.</p>

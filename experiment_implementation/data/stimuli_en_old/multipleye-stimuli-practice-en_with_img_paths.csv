2,Practice_second,"From my hotel room window, I see an oversized billboard with his face on it: Jason, the Great Magician.I absent-mindedly turn the pages of the phone book and come across a city map. Sipping my iced latté, I run my fingers along the streets from the hotel to the opera hall. Not more than a half-hour walk. I glance at the clock. The show starts in one hour. Plenty of time! I gulp the last three sips of my latté and hop in the shower. Soon I’m on my way to the show, carrying a fancy black handbag and a genuine smile. The billboard looks even more impressive from outside. The Great Jason's eyes seem to be glancing through me. ","I shiver and walk faster. I feel like a child about to open her birthday presents. The hall is dark when I come in; the show is about to begin. I make my way backstage just as the great magician puts on his top hat. ""Daddy, I'm so glad to see you,"" I say in a half-whisper. ""I'm in town for the writer's workshop, but I just couldn't miss your show."" I give him a quick hug and go back into the seating area, leaving him with a startled smile. I settle down in the darkness, and the curtains open. Magically, that show remains the Great Jason's best performance to this day.",,multiple choice,multiple choice,multiple choice,What is one of  goals of the MultiplEYE COST action?,Is this again a question?,What is a challenge of MultiplEYE?,To study how people learn for exams.,To investigate how the brain processes texts while reading.,To find out if people read a lot.,It can be used to find out if people are tired.,It is not really useful but researchers just find it fun to study it.,We can find out if two people are related.,To coordinate between different reasearch groups.,That there is no money provided for networking activitites.,There is already too much data available.,a,b,c,a,b,c,a,b,c,answer_option_1_2,answer_option_2_1,answer_option_3_1,,,To investigate how the brain processes texts while reading.,It can be used to find out if people are tired.,To coordinate between different reasearch groups.,b,,a,stimuli_en/practice_images/practice_second_id2_page_1_practice_en.png,practice_second_id2_page_1_practice_en.png,stimuli_en/practice_images/practice_second_id2_page_2_practice_en.png,practice_second_id2_page_2_practice_en.png,,,stimuli_en/practice_images/practice_second_id2_question_1_practice_en.png,practice_second_id2_question_1_practice_en.png,stimuli_en/practice_images/practice_second_id2_question_2_practice_en.png,practice_second_id2_question_2_practice_en.png,stimuli_en/practice_images/practice_second_id2_question_3_practice_en.png,practice_second_id2_question_3_practice_en.png

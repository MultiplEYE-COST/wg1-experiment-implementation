1,PopSci_MultiplEYE,Welcome to MultiplEYE!,"The name ""MultiplEYE"" is a wordplay combining ""multilingualism"" or ""multiple languages"" with ""eye"" from ""eye-tracking"". MultiplEYE is a COST Action funded by the European Union. COST Actions are research networks supported by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology or COST for short. As a funding organisation, COST supports our growing network of researchers across Europe and beyond by providing financial assistance for conducting different networking activities. ","These activities include working group meetings, training schools to share skills with younger researchers, and scientific research visits. The project title of the MultiplEYE COST Action is: Enabling multilingual eye-tracking data collection for human and machine language processing research. This means that the MultiplEYE COST Action aims to foster an interdisciplinary network of research groups working on collecting eye-tracking data from reading in multiple languages. ","The goal is to support the development of a large multilingual eye-tracking corpus and enable researchers to collect data by sharing their knowledge between various fields, including linguistics, psychology, speech and language pathology, and computer science. This data collection can then be used to study human language processing from a psycholinguistic perspective as well as to improve and evaluate computational language processing from a machine-learning perspective.","What is ""eye-tracking""?
Eye tracking is the process of measuring the point of gaze - where you are looking - and the movements of the eyes between fixed points of gaze. The device used to measure the eye positions and eye movements is called an eye tracker. It consists of an infrared camera, using a light frequency that does not bother or hurt the human eye. ","With the help of image recognition algorithms, the eye tracker can estimate gaze points very accurately by knowing the position of the head and eyes, the distance to the screen a participant is looking at and the eye tracker's position. Eye-tracking is a helpful technology for many applications. For example, it can help detect tiredness while driving or it can support applications for screening and training purposes in the medical domain. Eye-tracking is also used in gaming, marketing, and human-computer interaction.","Why is eye-tracking while reading especially interesting for our project?
As you read these words, the eye tracker follows your eye's movements over the text. This provides information about how long you spend looking at a text, or more specifically, how long you spent on each word, which words you skipped, which words you dwelled on, and whether you had to go back and reread parts of the text to understand it better.","As your brain is simultaneously processing the content of the text, your eye movements reflect a lot of the linguistic and cognitive processing going on almost in real time. Thus, the recorded data is a gold mine of information about how we put together a text's meaning and grammatical structures. It shows which parts of the text we struggle with and which parts are easily readable. It is up to the researchers to later explain which linguistic factors caused which type of eye movements.","The motivation behind MultiplEYE is that eye-tracking data is still sparse, especially for more minor languages. Such extensive data collection is a challenge in terms of developing and agreeing on the experimental design, the complexity, and the types of texts to be read by the participants. Other decisions that seem less relevant but are, in fact, very important include the font type and size the text is presented in, the order of the texts, the experiment procedure, and how the data will be processed. ","But once completed, this dataset will allow us to investigate many topics related to psycholinguistics and computational linguistics. For example, we can compare the reading behaviour across different languages. Does the scripture, for example, the Latin alphabet versus Cyrillic or Arabic scripts, impact reading times? An example concerning the computational processing of text could involve using eye-tracking data to advance artificial intelligence applications that imitate the human reading process. This could be used to build better machine translation systems or to improve the automatic extraction of keywords from the text.","Receiving eye-tracking data from many participants, including yourself, by reading texts in many different languages will be a great foundation for our research. It will be the main factor in turning our research network into a successful endeavour. We hope to clear the way for advancing research in various subfields of linguistics by supporting and connecting a large group of researchers. ","The main outcomes of the MultiplEYE Action will be a large dataset containing eye-tracking data in many languages and a platform for new collaborations building on this type of data. If you are reading this text, you are already supporting our cause by allowing us to collect and analyse your eye movements while reading and comprehending language.

3,Ins_EURLex,REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL: Progress report on a Learning Mobility Benchmark,"1. INTRODUCTION
The recent Commission Communication on Investing in Europe’s Youth highlights the positive impact of learning mobility on employability and active citizenship. Learning, studying and training in another country is a unique experience and can open up new horizons."," Skills gained during a mobility experience, such as problem-solving, adaptability, tolerance and confidence are valued by employers and essential for today’s society. The Commission encourages learning mobility of young people through its policies and programmes, including a dedicated benchmark and support from the Erasmus+ programme. ","The 2011 Council conclusions on a benchmark for learning mobility (2011/C372/08) invite the Commission to: ‘report back to the Council by the end of 2015, with a view to reviewing and, if necessary, revising the European benchmark on learning mobility.’
The Council conclusions also request the Commission and the Member States to carry out a number of other actions, in particular in regard to indicators on student, youth and teacher mobility. However, there is no obligation to report back to the Council linked to these actions. They are described in more detail in separate available Commission documentation.","The background to the 2011 Council conclusions is the Strategic Framework on European Cooperation in Education and Training 2020 which invites the Commission ‘to submit a proposal for a benchmark in this area by the end 2010, focusing initially on physical mobility between countries in the field of higher education...’. The Council conclusions were preceded by the Commission staff working document of 24 May 2011 on the development of benchmarks on education for employability and on learning mobility (doc. 10697/11). 
",This report fulfils the obligation of reporting back to the Council on the progress made regarding the mobility benchmark with a view to continuing the work towards 2020. ,"
The learning mobility benchmark consists of two indicators and is defined in the annex of the 2011 conclusions as:
- ‘By 2020, an EU average of at least 20 % of higher education graduates should have had a period of higher education-related study or training (including work placements) abroad, representing a minimum of 15 ECTS credits or lasting a minimum of 3 months.'
- 'By 2020, an EU average of at least 6 % of 18-34 year-olds with an initial vocational education and training qualification should have had an initial VET-related study or training period (including work placements) abroad lasting a minimum of 2 weeks, or less if documented by Europass.’'","The focus of the benchmark is on outward mobility: in other words, the extent to which individuals go abroad to gain learning experiences and qualifications. Within the EU, this objective is linked to the EU basic principles of the free movement of people and work within the internal market.
","The EU benchmark measures the number of graduates who have both been mobile during their studies and have successfully completed their qualifications. It does not directly specify a geographical area, but the 2011 Conclusions underline that: ‘learning mobility is defined as physical mobility and takes worldwide mobility into account’. The measurement of the IVET mobility benchmark indicator is in practice limited by the instrument implied in the Conclusions (a household survey of a specified broad age group), whereas the source for the higher education benchmark indicator is not specified.",,,,,,,,,,,,multiple choice,multiple choice,multiple choice,,,What is one of  goals of the MultiplEYE COST action?,,What is a challenge of MultiplEYE?,,,To study how people learn for exams.,To investigate how the brain processes texts while reading.,To find out if people read a lot.,It can be used to find out if people are tired.,It is not really useful but researchers just find it fun to study it.,We can find out if two people are related.,To coordinate between different reasearch groups.,That there is no money provided for networking activitites.,There is already too much data available.,,,,,,,a,b,c,,,,a,b,c,,,,,,,answer_option_1_2,answer_option_2_1,answer_option_3_1,,,To investigate how the brain processes texts while reading.,It can be used to find out if people are tired.,To coordinate between different reasearch groups.,,,b,,a,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/ins_eurlex_id3_page_1_en.png,ins_eurlex_id3_page_1_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/ins_eurlex_id3_page_2_en.png,ins_eurlex_id3_page_2_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/ins_eurlex_id3_page_3_en.png,ins_eurlex_id3_page_3_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/ins_eurlex_id3_page_4_en.png,ins_eurlex_id3_page_4_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/ins_eurlex_id3_page_5_en.png,ins_eurlex_id3_page_5_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/ins_eurlex_id3_page_6_en.png,ins_eurlex_id3_page_6_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/ins_eurlex_id3_page_7_en.png,ins_eurlex_id3_page_7_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/ins_eurlex_id3_page_8_en.png,ins_eurlex_id3_page_8_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/ins_eurlex_id3_page_9_en.png,ins_eurlex_id3_page_9_en.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/ins_eurlex_id3_question_1_en.png,ins_eurlex_id3_question_1_en.png,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/ins_eurlex_id3_question_3_en.png,ins_eurlex_id3_question_3_en.png,,,,
4,Lit_Alchemist,The Alchemist - Chapter 1,"The boy’s name was Santiago. Dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church. The roof had fallen in long ago, and an enormous sycamore had grown on the spot where the sacristy had once stood. He decided to spend the night there. He saw to it that all the sheep entered through the ruined gate, and then laid some planks across it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night. ","There were no wolves in the region, but once an animal had strayed during the night, and the boy had had to spend the entire next day searching for it. He swept the floor with his jacket and lay down, using the book he had just finished reading as a pillow. He told himself that he would have to start reading thicker books: they lasted longer, and made more comfortable pillows.","It was still dark when he awoke, and, looking up, he could see the stars through the half-destroyed roof. I wanted to sleep a little longer, he thought. He had had the same dream that night as a week ago, and once again he had awakened before it ended. He arose and, taking up his crook, began to awaken the sheep that still slept. He had noticed that, as soon as he awoke, most of his animals also began to stir. It was as if some mysterious energy bound his life to that of the sheep, with whom he had spent the past two years, leading them through the countryside in search of food and water.","“They are so used to me that they know my schedule,” he muttered. Thinking about that for a moment, he realized that it could be the other way around: that it was he who had become accustomed to their schedule. But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken. The boy prodded them, one by one, with his crook, calling each by name. He had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said. So there were times when he read them parts of his books that had made an impression on him, or when he would tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of a shepherd in the fields.","Sometimes he would comment to them on the things he had seen in the villages they passed. But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one thing: the girl, the daughter of a merchant who lived in the village they would reach in about four days. He had been to the village only once, the year before. The merchant was the proprietor of a dry goods shop, and he always demanded that the sheep be sheared in his presence, so that he would not be cheated. A friend had told the boy about the shop, and he had taken his sheep there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,multiple choice,multiple choice,multiple choice,,,What is one of  goals of the MultiplEYE COST action?,,What is a challenge of MultiplEYE?,,,To study how people learn for exams.,To investigate how the brain processes texts while reading.,To find out if people read a lot.,It can be used to find out if people are tired.,It is not really useful but researchers just find it fun to study it.,We can find out if two people are related.,To coordinate between different reasearch groups.,That there is no money provided for networking activitites.,There is already too much data available.,,,,,,,a,b,c,,,,a,b,c,,,,,,,answer_option_1_2,answer_option_2_1,answer_option_3_1,,,To investigate how the brain processes texts while reading.,It can be used to find out if people are tired.,To coordinate between different reasearch groups.,,,b,,a,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_alchemist_id4_page_1_en.png,lit_alchemist_id4_page_1_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_alchemist_id4_page_2_en.png,lit_alchemist_id4_page_2_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_alchemist_id4_page_3_en.png,lit_alchemist_id4_page_3_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_alchemist_id4_page_4_en.png,lit_alchemist_id4_page_4_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_alchemist_id4_page_5_en.png,lit_alchemist_id4_page_5_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_alchemist_id4_page_6_en.png,lit_alchemist_id4_page_6_en.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_alchemist_id4_question_1_en.png,lit_alchemist_id4_question_1_en.png,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_alchemist_id4_question_3_en.png,lit_alchemist_id4_question_3_en.png,,,,
5,Lit_Emperor_Clothes,The Emperor's New Clothes,"Many years ago there lived an emperor who was so terribly fond of beautiful new clothes that he spent all his money on being elegantly dressed. Only if he got the chance to show off his new clothes did he show any interest in his soldiers, the theatre or going for a coach ride in the woods. He had a dress coat for every hour of the day, and just as one says about a king that he is in council, one always said in his case: ‘The emperor’s in the wardrobes!’","Life was most enjoyable in the great city where he lived, every day many strangers came – and one day two swindlers did; they pretended to be weavers and said they were able to weave the loveliest cloth one could imagine. Not only were the colours and pattern exceptionally beautiful but the clothes sewn from the cloth had the remarkable ability to become invisible to each and every person who was unfit for his office, or who was inadmissibly stupid.","‘A fine sort of clothes to have,’ the emperor thought; ‘ by wearing them I could find out which men in my empire were unfit for the office they hold and I would be able to distinguish between clever and stupid people! Yes, that cloth must be woven for me at once!’ and he gave the two swindlers a great deal of money in advance to begin their work.","They set up two looms and pretended to be working, but they hadn’t anything at all on them. Without more ado, they demanded the finest silk, and the most magnificent gold – this they kept for themselves and they worked away at the empty looms until late at night. ‘I wonder how they’re getting on with the cloth!’ the emperor thought to himself, but he had a distinctly uneasy feeling when he recalled that anyone who was stupid or unfit for his office wouldn’t be able to see it – he didn’t think that he really needed to worry about himself, but he decided even so to send someone first to see how things were progressing. ","Everyone in the whole city knew what a strange power the cloth had, and everyone was eager to find out how incompetent or stupid his neighbour was. ‘I’ll send my honest old minister to the weavers!’ the emperor thought, ‘he’s best able to see what the cloth looks like, for he’s an intelligent man, and no one attends to his office better than he does!’ Now the worthy old minister entered the room where the two swindlers were working at the empty looms. ‘Good gracious me!’ the old minister thought, opening his eyes wide: ‘I can’t see anything!’ But he didn’t say that.","Both swindlers asked him to be so kind as to step closer and asked him if he didn’t think it was a lovely pattern and delightful colours they were weaving. They pointed to the empty loom, and the poor minister’s eyes were as wide-open as ever, but he couldn’t see anything, for there wasn’t anything to see. ‘Good lord!’ he thought, ‘Am I stupid, perhaps! I’ve never believed so, and no one must ever know about it! am I unfit for my office perhaps? No, it will never do for me to say that I can’t see the cloth!’ ‘Well, have you nothing to say about it?’ said the one who was weaving.","‘Oh, it’s splendid! ever so delightful!’ the old minister said, peering through his glasses, ‘this pattern and those colours! oh yes, I shall certainly tell the emperor it appeals to me exceedingly well!’ ‘A pleasure to hear it!’ both weavers said, and they now named the colours by name as well as the quite exceptional pattern. The old minister listened carefully, for he would have to be able to say the same when he got back to the emperor, and he did just that. Now the swindlers asked for more money, more silk and gold – they needed it for the weaving. ","They stuffed everything into their own pockets, not a single thread ended up on the loom, but they continued to weave on the empty loom as before. After a short while, the emperor sent another worthy official to them to see how the weaving was coming along, and if the cloth would soon be ready. Exactly the same thing happened as with the former one: he looked and looked, but since there was nothing apart from the empty loom, he couldn’t see anything. ‘Yes, isn’t it an exquisite piece of cloth!’ both the swindlers said, and they showed and explained to him the delightful patterns that were not there at all.","‘I’m not stupid!’ the man thought, ‘so is it my office that I’m unfit for? That’s odd enough! but I mustn’t let anybody notice that!’ and he praised the cloth he couldn’t see, and assured them how pleased he was with the lovely colours and the wonderful pattern. ‘It’s simply ever so delightful!’ he said to the emperor. Everyone in the city talked about the magnificent cloth.","Now the emperor wanted to see for himself while it was still on the loom. With a whole host of distinguished men, which included the two worthy officials who had been there before, he went to both of the cunning swindlers who were now weaving with all their might, but without a single thread. ‘Yes, is it not magnifique!’ both the worthy officials said. ‘Perhaps His Majesty would look at what patterns, what colours we have here!’ and they pointed at the empty loom, for they believed that the others could surely see the cloth.","‘What’s all this?!’ the emperor thought, ‘I can’t see a thing! but this is terrible! am I stupid? am I unfit to be emperor? that would be the worst possible thing that could befall me!’ ‘Oh, it’s extremely beautiful!,’ the emperor said, ‘it has my highest approval!’ and he nodded contentedly and gazed at the empty loom – he didn’t want to say that he couldn’t see anything. The whole retinue he had with him looked and looked, but they got nothing more out of it than all the others, although they said, just like the emperor, ‘oh, it’s very beautiful!’ and they advised him to wear these wonderful new clothes for the first time at the great procession that was about to take place. ","‘It’s magnifique! exquisite, excellent!’ went from mouth to mouth, and everyone was extremely pleased about it. The emperor gave each of the swindlers a cross of the order of chivalry to hang in his buttonhole and the title of squire of the loom. The whole night before the morning of the procession the swindlers sat up and had more than sixteen candles lit. People could see they were busy getting the emperor’s new clothes finished. They pretended to take the cloth from the weave, they snipped in the air with large scissors, they sewed with sewing needles without thread and finally said: ‘Just look, now the clothes are ready!’","The emperor, with his gentlemen in waiting, came to see for himself and both the swindlers raised one arm in the air as if they were holding something and said: ‘Look, here are the trousers! here is the dress coat! here the cloak!’ and so on and so forth. ‘It’s as light as gossamer! one would almost think one was wearing nothing at all, but that of course is its special virtue!’ ‘Yes,’ all the gentlemen in waiting said, but they couldn’t see anything because there wasn’t anything to see.","‘If His Imperial Majesty would now be kind enough to remove His clothes, we will put on His new ones over here in front of the great mirror!’ The emperor took off all his clothes, and the swindlers behaved as if they were putting on each item of the new clothes they said had been sewn, and the emperor turned this way and that in front of the mirror. ‘Good heavens, how well they suit Your Majesty! what a perfect fit they are!’ they all said. ‘What a pattern! what colours! it is a gorgeous costume!’","‘They are standing outside with the royal canopy to be borne above Your Majesty in the procession,’ the head master of ceremonies said. ‘Yes, well, now I’m really dressed for it!’ the emperor said. ‘Don’t they sit well on me?’ and turned an extra time in front of the mirror! for now it was to seem as if he really was contemplating his finery.","His chamberlains, who were to bear his train, groped along the floor with their hands, as if they were picking up the train, they walked forward holding the air, they didn’t dare let anyone notice that they couldn’t see anything. Then the emperor walked in procession under the lovely canopy and everyone in the street and at the windows said: ‘Good heavens, how incomparable the emperor’s clothes are! what a delightful train his dress coat has! what a marvellous fit!’ No one wanted anyone to notice that he couldn’t see anything, for then he would have been unfit for his office, or have been very stupid.","None of the emperor’s previous clothes had ever been such a success. ‘But he hasn’t got anything on!’ a small child said. ‘Good gracious, just listen to the innocent child,’ his father said; and each person whispered to the next one what the child had said. ‘But he hasn’t got anything on,’ all his people finally cried out. This gave the emperor the shivers, for he sensed they were right, but he reasoned: ‘Now I’ll have to stick the procession out.’ And the chamberlains walked on bearing the train that wasn’t there.",,,multiple choice,multiple choice,multiple choice,,,What is one of  goals of the MultiplEYE COST action?,,What is a challenge of MultiplEYE?,,,To study how people learn for exams.,To investigate how the brain processes texts while reading.,To find out if people read a lot.,It can be used to find out if people are tired.,It is not really useful but researchers just find it fun to study it.,We can find out if two people are related.,To coordinate between different reasearch groups.,That there is no money provided for networking activitites.,There is already too much data available.,,,,,,,a,b,c,,,,a,b,c,,,,,,,answer_option_1_2,answer_option_2_1,answer_option_3_1,,,To investigate how the brain processes texts while reading.,It can be used to find out if people are tired.,To coordinate between different reasearch groups.,,,b,,a,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_1_en.png,lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_1_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_2_en.png,lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_2_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_3_en.png,lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_3_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_4_en.png,lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_4_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_5_en.png,lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_5_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_6_en.png,lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_6_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_7_en.png,lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_7_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_8_en.png,lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_8_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_9_en.png,lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_9_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_10_en.png,lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_10_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_11_en.png,lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_11_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_12_en.png,lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_12_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_13_en.png,lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_13_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_14_en.png,lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_14_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_15_en.png,lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_15_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_16_en.png,lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_16_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_17_en.png,lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_17_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_18_en.png,lit_emperor_clothes_id5_page_18_en.png,,,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_emperor_clothes_id5_question_1_en.png,lit_emperor_clothes_id5_question_1_en.png,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_emperor_clothes_id5_question_3_en.png,lit_emperor_clothes_id5_question_3_en.png,,,,

They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense. ","Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. ","The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. ","The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that. ","When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair. ","None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.
At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house.

7,Lit_MagicMountain,The Magic Mountain - Foreword ,"The story of Hans Gistorp, which we would here set forth, not on his own account, for in him the reader will make acquaintance with a simple-minded though pleasing young man, but for the sake of the story itself, which seems to us highly worth telling — though it must needs be borne in mind, in Hans Castorp’s behalf, that it is his story, and not every story happens to everybody — this story, we say, belongs to the long ago; is already, so to speak, covered with historic mould, and unquestionably to be presented in the tense best suited to a narrative out of the depth or the past. ","That should be no drawback to a story, but rather the reverse. Since histories must be in the past, then the more past the better, it would seem, for them in their character as histories, and for him, the teller of them, rounding wizard of times gone by. With this story, moreover, it stands as it does to-day with human beings, not least among them writers of tales: it is far older than its years; its age may not be measured by length of days, nor the weight of time on its head reckoned by the rising or setting of suns. In a word, the degree of its antiquity has noways to do with the passage of time — in which statement the author intentionally touches upon the strange and questionable double nature of that riddling element. ","But we would not wilfully obscure a plain matter. The exaggerated pastness of our narrative is due to its taking place before the epoch when a certain crisis shattered its way through life and consciousness and left a deep chasm behind. It takes place — or, rather, deliberately to avoid the present tense, it took place, and had taken place — in the long ago, in the old days, the days of the world before the Great War, in the beginning of which so much began that has scarcely yet left off beginning. Yes, it took place before that; yet not so long before. Is not the pastness of the past the profounder, the completer, the more legendary, the more immediately before the present it falls? ","More than that, our story has, of its own nature, something of the legend about it now and again. We shall tell it at length, thoroughly, in detail - for when did a narrative seem too long or too short by reason of the actual time or space it took up? We do not fear being called meticulous, inclining as we do to the view that only the exhaustive can be truly interesting. ","Not all in a minute, then, will the narrator be finished with the story of our Hans. The seven days of a week will not suffice, no, nor seven months either. Best not too soon make too plain how much mortal time must pass over his head while he sits spun round in his spell. Heaven forbid it should be seven years!

9,Lit_Solaris,Solaris - Chapter 2: The Solarists,"The discovery of Solaris dated from about 100 years before I was born. The planet orbits two suns: a red sun and a blue sun. For 45 years after its discovery, no spacecraft had visited Solaris. At that time, the Gamow-Shapley theory — that life was impossible on planets which are satellites of two solar bodies — was firmly believed. The orbit is constantly being modified by variations in the gravitational pull in the course of its revolutions around the two suns. ","Due to these fluctuations in gravity, the orbit is either flattened or distended and the elements of life, if they appear, are inevitably destroyed, either by intense heat or an extreme drop in temperature. These changes take place at intervals estimated in millions of years — very short intervals, that is, according to the laws of astronomy and biology (evolution takes hundreds of millions of years if not a billion). ","According to the earliest calculations, in 500,000 years’ time Solaris would be drawn one half of an astronomic unit nearer to its red sun, and a million years after that would be engulfed by the incandescent star. A few decades later, however, observations seemed to suggest that the planet’s orbit was in no way subject to the expected variations: it was stable, as stable as the orbit of the planets in our own solar system. ",The observations and calculations were reworked with great precision; they simply confirmed the original conclusions: Solaris’s orbit was unstable. A modest item among the hundreds of planets discovered annually — to which official statistics devoted only a few lines defining the characteristics of their orbits — Solaris eventually began to attract special attention and attain a high rank. ,"Four years after this promotion, overflying the planet with the Laakon and two auxiliary craft, the Ottenskjold expedition undertook a study of Solaris. This expedition being in the nature of a preliminary, not to say improvised reconnaissance, the scientists were not equipped for a landing. Ottenskjold placed a quantity of automatic observation satellites into equatorial and polar orbit, their principal function being to measure the gravitational pull. ","In addition, a study was made of the planet’s surface, which is covered by an ocean dotted with innumerable flat, low-lying islands whose combined area is less than that of Europe, although the diameter of Solaris is a fifth greater than Earth’s. These expanses of barren, rocky territory, irregularly distributed, are largely concentrated in the southern hemisphere.","At the same time the composition of the atmosphere — devoid of oxygen — was analyzed, and precise measurements made of the planet’s density, from which its albedo and other astronomical characteristics were determined. As was foreseeable, no trace of life was discovered, either on the islands or in the ocean. ","During the following ten years, Solaris became the center of attraction for all observatories oncerned with the study of this region of space, for the planet had in the meantime shown the astonishing faculty of maintaining an orbit which ought, without any shadow of doubt, to have been unstable. The problem almost developed into a scandal: since the results of the observations could only be inaccurate, attempts were made (in the interests of science) to denounce and discredit various scientists or else the computers they used. ","Lack of funds delayed the departure of a proper Solaris expedition for three years. Finally Shannahan assembled his team and obtained three C-tonnage vessels from the Institute, the largest starships of the period. A year and a half before the arrival of the expedition, which left from the region of Alpha in Aquarius, a second exploration fleet, acting in the name of the Institute, placed an automatic satellite — Luna 247 — into orbit around Solaris. ","This satellite, after three successive reconstructions at roughly ten-year intervals, is still functioning today. The data it supplied confirmed beyond doubt the findings of the Ottenskjold expedition concerning the active character of the ocean’s movements. One of Shannahan’s ships remained in orbit, while the two others, after some preliminary attempts, landed in the southern hemisphere, in a rocky area about 600 miles square. ","The work of the expedition lasted eighteen months and was carried out under favorable conditions, apart from an unfortunate accident brought about by the malfunction of some apparatus. In the meantime, the scientists had split into two opposing camps; the bone of contention was the ocean. On the basis of the analyses, it had been accepted that the ocean was an organic formation (at that time, no one had yet dared to call it living). ","But, while the biologists considered it as a primitive formation — a sort of gigantic entity, a fluid cell, unique and monstrous (which they called ‘prebiological’), surrounding the globe with a colloidal envelope several miles thick in places — the astronomers and physicists asserted that it must be an organic structure, extraordinarily evolved. According to them, the ocean possibly exceeded terrestrial organic structures in complexity, since it was capable of exerting an active influence on the planet’s orbital path. ","Certainly, no other factor could be found that might explain the behavior of Solaris; moreover, the planetophysicists had established a relationship between certain processes of the plasmic ocean and the local measurements of gravitational pull, which altered according to the ‘matter transformations’ of the ocean. Consequently it was the physicists, rather than the biologists, who put forward the paradoxical formulation of a ‘plasmic mechanism,’ implying by this a structure, possibly without life as we conceive it, but capable of performing functional activities — on an astronomic scale, it should be emphasized. ","It was during this quarrel, whose reverberations soon reached the ears of the most eminent authorities, that the Gamow-Shapley doctrine, unchallenged for eighty years, was shaken for the first time. There were some who continued to support the Gamow-Shapley contentions, to the effect that the ocean had nothing to do with life, that it was neither ‘parabiological’ nor ‘prebiological’ but a geological formation — of extreme rarity, it is true — with the unique ability to stabilize the orbit of Solaris, despite the variations in the forces of attraction. Le Chatelier’s law was enlisted in support of this argument. ","To challenge this conservative attitude, new hypotheses were advanced — of which Civito-Vitta’s was one of the most elaborate — proclaiming that the ocean was the product of a dialectical development: on the basis of its earliest pre-oceanic form, a solution of slow-reacting chemical elements, and by the force of circumstances (the threat to its existence from the changes of orbit), it had reached in a single bound the stage of ‘homeostatic ocean,’ without passing through all the stages of terrestrial evolution, by-passing the unicellular and multicellular phases, the vegetable and the animal, the development of a nervous and cerebral system."," In other words, unlike terrestrial organisms, it had not taken hundreds of millions of years to adapt itself to its environment — culminating in the first representatives of a species endowed with reason — but dominated its environment immediately. This was an original point of view. Nevertheless, the means whereby this colloidal envelope was able to stabilize the planet’s orbit remained unknown. For almost a century, devices had existed capable of creating artificial magnetic and gravitational fields; they were called gravitors. ","But no one could even guess how this formless glue could produce an effect which the gravitors achieved by the use of complicated nuclear reactions and enormously high temperatures. The newspapers of the day, exciting the curiosity of the layman and the anger of the scientist, were full of the most improbable embroideries on the theme of the ‘Solaris Mystery,’ one reporter going so far as to suggest that the ocean was, no less, a distant relation to our electric eels! Just when a measure of success had been achieved in unravelling this problem, it turned out, as often happened subsequently in the field of Solarist studies, that the explanation replaced one enigma by another, perhaps even more baffling.","Observations showed, at least, that the ocean did not react according to the same principles as our gravitors (which, in any case, would have been impossible), but succeeded in controlling the orbital periodicity directly. One result, among others, was the discovery of discrepancies in the measurement of time along one and the same meridian on Solaris. Thus the ocean was not only in a sense “aware” of the Einstein-Boevia theory; it was also capable of exploiting the implications of the latter (which was more than we could say of ourselves). ","With the publication of this hypothesis, the scientific world was torn by one of the most violent controversies of the century. Revered and universally accepted theories foundered; the specialist literature was swamped by outrageous and heretical treatises; ‘sentient ocean’ or ‘gravity-controlling colloid’ — the debate became a burning issue.",multiple choice,multiple choice,multiple choice,,,What is one of  goals of the MultiplEYE COST action?,,What is a challenge of MultiplEYE?,,,To study how people learn for exams.,To investigate how the brain processes texts while reading.,To find out if people read a lot.,It can be used to find out if people are tired.,It is not really useful but researchers just find it fun to study it.,We can find out if two people are related.,To coordinate between different reasearch groups.,That there is no money provided for networking activitites.,There is already too much data available.,,,,,,,a,b,c,,,,a,b,c,,,,,,,answer_option_1_2,answer_option_2_1,answer_option_3_1,,,To investigate how the brain processes texts while reading.,It can be used to find out if people are tired.,To coordinate between different reasearch groups.,,,b,,a,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_solaris_id9_page_1_en.png,lit_solaris_id9_page_1_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_solaris_id9_page_2_en.png,lit_solaris_id9_page_2_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_solaris_id9_page_3_en.png,lit_solaris_id9_page_3_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_solaris_id9_page_4_en.png,lit_solaris_id9_page_4_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_solaris_id9_page_5_en.png,lit_solaris_id9_page_5_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_solaris_id9_page_6_en.png,lit_solaris_id9_page_6_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_solaris_id9_page_7_en.png,lit_solaris_id9_page_7_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_solaris_id9_page_8_en.png,lit_solaris_id9_page_8_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_solaris_id9_page_9_en.png,lit_solaris_id9_page_9_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_solaris_id9_page_10_en.png,lit_solaris_id9_page_10_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_solaris_id9_page_11_en.png,lit_solaris_id9_page_11_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_solaris_id9_page_12_en.png,lit_solaris_id9_page_12_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_solaris_id9_page_13_en.png,lit_solaris_id9_page_13_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_solaris_id9_page_14_en.png,lit_solaris_id9_page_14_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_solaris_id9_page_15_en.png,lit_solaris_id9_page_15_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_solaris_id9_page_16_en.png,lit_solaris_id9_page_16_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_solaris_id9_page_17_en.png,lit_solaris_id9_page_17_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_solaris_id9_page_18_en.png,lit_solaris_id9_page_18_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_solaris_id9_page_19_en.png,lit_solaris_id9_page_19_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_solaris_id9_page_20_en.png,lit_solaris_id9_page_20_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_solaris_id9_question_1_en.png,lit_solaris_id9_question_1_en.png,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_solaris_id9_question_3_en.png,lit_solaris_id9_question_3_en.png,,,,

Now, before them and on either side there stretched away heathland on a slight slope, a rather strange piece of country, neither plain, nor mountain nor plateau. ","The mountains, properly speaking, had not yet begun, but one felt their looming shadow, and it seemed that it was that very shadow which while rejecting any connection between the plateau and the mountain world, kept it from being classed as a plain. So it was a border region, barren and almost uninhabited.","“The Accursed Mountains,” he said softly, with a slight tremor in his voice, as if he were greeting a vision that he had been expecting for a very long time.

The jostling of the carriage sent the newspaper in which they were mentioned, and which they had bought in the small town a little before their departure, sliding to the floor, but neither of them moved to pick it up. She smiled vaguely, recalling the title of the short piece announcing their trip: “Sensation: The writer, Bessian Vorpsi, and his young bride are spending their honeymoon on the Northern Plateau!”","The article was rather vague. You could not tell whether the author, a certain A.G. (could that be their acquaintance, Adrian Guma?) was in favor of the trip or was being slightly ironic about it.","She herself, when her fiance had announced it to her two weeks before the wedding, had thought the idea pretty bizarre. Don’t be surprised at anything, her friends had told her. If you marry a man who’s a bit odd, you have to expect surprises. But at bottom we have to say you’re very lucky.","And in fact she was happy. During the last days before the wedding, in the half-fashionable, half-artistic circles of Tirana, people talked about nothing but their honeymoon trip. Her friends envied her and told her: You’ll be escaping the world of reality for the world of legend, literally the world of epic that scarcely exists anymore. ","And they would go on talking about fairies, mountain nymphs, bards, the last Homeric hymns in the world, and the Kanun, terrifying but so majestic. Others shrugged their shoulders at all this enthusiasm, hinting discreetly at their astonishment, which was aroused particularly by the question of comfort, the more so since this was a honeymoon trip, something that called for certain conveniences, whereas, in the mountains the weather was still quite cold, and those epic kullas were of stone.","On the other hand, there were others— few in number—who listened to all those opinions with a rather amused air, as if to say, “Right, go on up north among the mountain nymphs. It will do both of you good, and especially Bessian.",,,,,,,,,,multiple choice,multiple choice,multiple choice,,,What is one of  goals of the MultiplEYE COST action?,,What is a challenge of MultiplEYE?,,,To study how people learn for exams.,To investigate how the brain processes texts while reading.,To find out if people read a lot.,It can be used to find out if people are tired.,It is not really useful but researchers just find it fun to study it.,We can find out if two people are related.,To coordinate between different reasearch groups.,That there is no money provided for networking activitites.,There is already too much data available.,,,,,,,a,b,c,,,,a,b,c,,,,,,,answer_option_1_2,answer_option_2_1,answer_option_3_1,,,To investigate how the brain processes texts while reading.,It can be used to find out if people are tired.,To coordinate between different reasearch groups.,,,b,,a,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_page_1_en.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_page_1_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_page_2_en.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_page_2_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_page_3_en.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_page_3_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_page_4_en.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_page_4_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_page_5_en.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_page_5_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_page_6_en.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_page_6_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_page_7_en.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_page_7_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_page_8_en.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_page_8_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_page_9_en.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_page_9_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_page_10_en.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_page_10_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_page_11_en.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_page_11_en.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_question_1_en.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_question_1_en.png,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_question_3_en.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_question_3_en.png,,,,

Imagine that a local library is hosting a lecture next week. The lecture will be given by a professor from a nearby university. She will discuss her field work on the island of Rapa Nui in the Pacific Ocean, over 3200 kilometres west of Chile.","Your history class will attend the lecture. Your teacher asks you to research the history of Rapa Nui so that you will know something about it before you attend the lecture.
The first source you will read is a blog entry written by the professor while she was living on Rapa Nui.","www.theprofessorblog.com/fieldwork/RapaNui
The Professor’s Blog
Posted May 23, 11:22 a.m.","As I look out of my window this morning, I see the landscape I have learned to love here on Rapa Nui, which is known in some places by the name Easter Island. The grasses and shrubs are green, the sky is blue, and the old, now extinct volcanoes rise up in the background.","I am a bit sad knowing that this is my last week on the island. I have finished my field work and will be returning home. Later today, I will take a walk through the hills and say good-bye to the moai that I have been studying for the past nine months. Here is a picture of some of these massive statues.","If you have been following my blog this year, then you know that the people of Rapa Nui carved these moai hundreds of years ago. These impressive moai had been carved in a single quarry on the eastern part of the island. Some of them weighed thousands of kilos, yet the people of Rapa Nui were able to move them to locations far away from the quarry without cranes or any heavy equipment.","For years, archeologists did not know how these massive statues were moved. It remained a mystery until the 1990s, when a team of archeologists and residents of Rapa Nui demonstrated that the moai could have been transported and raised using ropes made from plants and wooden rollers and tracks made from large trees that had once thrived on the island. The mystery of the moai was solved.","Another mystery remained, however. What happened to these plants and large trees that had been used to move the moai? As I said, when I look out of my window, I see grasses and shrubs and a small tree or two, but nothing that could have been used to move these huge statues. It is a fascinating puzzle, one that I will explore in future posts and lectures. Until then, you may wish to investigate the mystery yourself. I suggest you begin with a book called Collapse by Jared Diamond. This review of Collapse is a good place to start.","Traveler_14 May 24, 4:31 p.m.
""Hi Professor! I love following your work on Easter Island. I can’t wait to check out Collapse!""

""I also love reading about your experiences on Easter Island, however, I think there is another theory that should be considered. Check out this article: www.sciencenews.com/Polynesian_rats_Rapa_Nui""","www.academicbookreview.com/Collapse
Review of Collapse","Jared Diamond’s new book, Collapse, is a clear warning about the consequences of damaging our environment. In the book, the author describes several civilizations that collapsed because of the choices they made and their impact on the environment. One of the most disturbing examples in the book is Rapa Nui.","According to the author, Rapa Nui was settled by Polynesians sometime after 700 CE. They developed a thriving society of, perhaps, 15 000 people. They carved the moai, the famous statues, and used the natural resources available to them to move these huge moai to different locations around the island. When the first Europeans landed on Rapa Nui in 1722, the moai were still there, but the trees were gone.", The population was down to a few thousand people who were struggling to survive. Mr. Diamond writes that the people of Rapa Nui cleared the land for farming and other purposes and that they over-hunted the numerous species of sea and land birds that had lived on the island. He speculates that the dwindling natural resources led to civil wars and the collapse of Rapa Nui’s society.,"The lesson of this wonderful but frightening book is that in the past, humans made the choice to destroy their environment by cutting down all the trees and hunting animal species to extinction. Optimistically, the author points out, we can choose not to make the same mistakes today. The book is written well and deserves to be read by anyone who is concerned about the environment.",,,,,,multiple choice,multiple choice,multiple choice,,,What is one of  goals of the MultiplEYE COST action?,,What is a challenge of MultiplEYE?,,,To study how people learn for exams.,To investigate how the brain processes texts while reading.,To find out if people read a lot.,It can be used to find out if people are tired.,It is not really useful but researchers just find it fun to study it.,We can find out if two people are related.,To coordinate between different reasearch groups.,That there is no money provided for networking activitites.,There is already too much data available.,,,,,,,a,b,c,,,,a,b,c,,,,,,,answer_option_1_2,answer_option_2_1,answer_option_3_1,,,To investigate how the brain processes texts while reading.,It can be used to find out if people are tired.,To coordinate between different reasearch groups.,,,b,,a,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_1_en.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_1_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_2_en.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_2_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_3_en.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_3_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_4_en.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_4_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_5_en.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_5_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_6_en.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_6_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_7_en.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_7_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_8_en.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_8_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_9_en.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_9_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_10_en.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_10_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_11_en.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_11_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_12_en.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_12_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_13_en.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_13_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_14_en.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_14_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_15_en.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_15_en.png,,,,,,,,,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_question_1_en.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_question_1_en.png,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_question_3_en.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_question_3_en.png,,,,

In some places, like the United States, drinking cow’s milk is common.
Imagine that three students, Anna, Christopher and Sam, are at a coffee shop in the United States. The owner recently placed a sign in the window that stated: “After April 5th we will no longer serve cow’s milk here. Instead, we will offer a milk substitute made from soy.”
Anna, Christopher and Sam are curious about why the coffee shop would stop serving cow’s milk, so Anna does an Internet search on her smartphone for “cow’s milk”. They look at the first result and discuss it.","www.farmtomarketdairy.com
FARM TO MARKET DAIRY
The Nutritional Value of Milk: Countless Benefits!","Farm to Market Dairy milk products contain key nutrients: calcium, protein, vitamin D, vitamin B12, riboflavin, and potassium. These vitamins and minerals make Farm to Market Dairy milk products an important part of a healthful diet. Consuming Farm to Market Dairy milk products every day is a great way to ensure that you get the vitamins and minerals your body needs.","Consuming Farm to Market Dairy milk products increases weight loss and helps maintain a healthy weight. Milk increases bone strength and density. It even improves cardiovascular health and helps prevent cancer. One glass of milk is packed with vitamins, minerals, and a wealth of health benefits.","According to Bill Sears, MD, Associate Clinical Professor of Pediatrics at the University of California at Irvine, milk contains many important nutrients in one convenient place. The International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) supports this idea. In fact, the IDFA suggests that many health professionals and groups would also agree.","Milk contains a complete nutrient package of nine essential nutrients. In addition to being an excellent source of calcium and vitamin D, it is a good source of vitamin A, protein and potassium. Dairy is recommended by doctors. Dairy’s role in a healthy diet has long been established by the nutrition and science community. This includes the National Osteoporosis Foundation, the Surgeon General, the National Institutes of Health, the American Medical Association’s Council of Scientific Affairs and many other leading health organizations.
International Dairy Foods Association, September 27, 2007","Anna, Christopher and Sam are talking about the decision of the coffee shop owner to stop selling cow’s milk. Sam says, “Maybe cow’s milk is becoming too expensive.” Christopher is looking at his smartphone. “Maybe, but I did a web search on cow’s milk too. I’m going to text you the link to a more recent article that may explain it.”
Anna and Sam open the link Christopher sent and read the article, “Just Say ‘No’ to Cow’s Milk!”","www.healtharticlestoday.com/milk

JUST SAY 'NO' TO COW’S MILK!
By Health Reporter, Dr. R. Garza","Cow’s milk is a big part of many people’s lives in the United States. Babies drink cow’s milk in bottles. Children eat cereal drenched in cow’s milk. Even adults enjoy a cold glass of milk from time to time. Yes, cow’s milk is a huge part of the human diet in many places around the world. However, more and more research is suggesting that milk may not “do a body good” as the popular American advertising slogan claims.","The United States Department of Agriculture, the American Dairy Council, Dairy Management, Inc., and other organizations have worked hard to advocate for milk for many years. They encourage adults to drink at least three glasses of milk a day. However, several studies in the last decade have questioned the bone-strengthening power of milk as well as other claims about the health benefits of milk. The results may surprise you.","One of the most recent and most important studies on the effects of drinking milk was published in the October 2014 issue of the British Medical Journal. The findings in this study led to some powerful assertions about the consumption of milk. In this study over 100 000 people in Sweden were followed over periods of 20-30 years. Researchers found that the female milk drinkers suffered more bone fractures. Additionally, both male and female milk drinkers were more likely to suffer from heart disease and cancer. These staggering results are similar to findings from other studies.","The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) commented on some of the health problems related to the consumption of milk. It claims that milk and dairy products “have little or no benefit for bones.” The PCRM goes further to describe some specific problems associated with milk: “Milk proteins, milk sugar, fat, and saturated fat in dairy products pose health risks for children and encourage the development of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.”","These are serious claims and more studies are needed in order to confirm the findings. However, there is mounting proof that drinking cow’s milk could be less beneficial to our health than originally thought. If these claims become indisputable facts, it may be time to just say `no` to cow´s milk.",,,,,,,multiple choice,multiple choice,multiple choice,,,What is one of  goals of the MultiplEYE COST action?,,What is a challenge of MultiplEYE?,,,To study how people learn for exams.,To investigate how the brain processes texts while reading.,To find out if people read a lot.,It can be used to find out if people are tired.,It is not really useful but researchers just find it fun to study it.,We can find out if two people are related.,To coordinate between different reasearch groups.,That there is no money provided for networking activitites.,There is already too much data available.,,,,,,,a,b,c,,,,a,b,c,,,,,,,answer_option_1_2,answer_option_2_1,answer_option_3_1,,,To investigate how the brain processes texts while reading.,It can be used to find out if people are tired.,To coordinate between different reasearch groups.,,,b,,a,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_1_en.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_1_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_2_en.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_2_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_3_en.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_3_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_4_en.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_4_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_5_en.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_5_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_6_en.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_6_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_7_en.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_7_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_8_en.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_8_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_9_en.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_9_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_10_en.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_10_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_11_en.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_11_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_12_en.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_12_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_13_en.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_13_en.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_14_en.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_14_en.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_question_1_en.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_question_1_en.png,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_question_3_en.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_question_3_en.png,,,,

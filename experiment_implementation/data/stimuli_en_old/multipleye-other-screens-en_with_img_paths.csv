6,instruction_screen,"In this experiment you will read a series of texts of differing length. Each text is divided into multiple pages (screens). Please read the text as you would read any other text. When you are finished with one page, look at the bottom right corner of the screen and press the **space bar.** Then the next page will appear. After each text you will have to answer a few multiple choice questions about the text. You can use the keyboard to pick an answer. **You won't be able to go back to a page or a question you have already read.**

Right before each new text screen there is a fixation dot shown at the top left corner of the screen. The next page will only appear if you steadily look at the dot.

In between two texts there might be a re-calibration.",This screen will be shown at the beginning of the exp (the practice stimuli) after the camera setup and the calibration. ,instruction_screen_en.png,stimuli_en/other_screens/instruction_screen_en.png

pymovements: A Python package for eye movement data processing, ETRA 2023","We introduce pymovements: a Python package for analyzing eye-tracking data that follows best practices in software development, including rigorous testing and adherence to coding standards. The package provides functionality for key processes along the entire preprocessing pipeline. This includes parsing of eye tracker data files, transforming positional data into velocity data, detecting gaze events like saccades and fixations, computing event properties like saccade amplitude and fixational dispersion and visualizing data and results with several types of plotting methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,block_1,data/stimuli_toy_x_1/aoi_stimuli_images_toy_x_1/toy_text_1_id1_page_1_toy_aoi.png,toy_text_1_id1_page_1_toy_aoi.png,data/stimuli_toy_x_1/aoi_stimuli_images_toy_x_1/toy_text_1_id1_page_2_toy_aoi.png,toy_text_1_id1_page_2_toy_aoi.png,data/stimuli_toy_x_1/aoi_stimuli_images_toy_x_1/toy_text_1_id1_page_3_toy_aoi.png,toy_text_1_id1_page_3_toy_aoi.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,toy_text_2,experiment,Eye tracking,"Eye movements in reading are known to reflect cognitive processes involved in reading comprehension at all linguistic levels, from the sub-lexical to the discourse level. This means that reading comprehension and other properties of the text and/or the reader should be possible to infer from eye movements. Consequently, we develop the first neural sequence architecture for this type of tasks which models scan paths in reading and incorporates lexical, semantic and other linguistic features of the stimulus text. Our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models in various tasks.

The grounds here were more confined, the flower-beds showed no very careful tendance, and large clumps of trees, chiefly of sombre yews, had risen high, not ten yards from the windows. The building, of greenish stone, was in the old English style, not ugly, but small-windowed and melancholy-looking: the sort of house that must have children, many flowers, open windows, and little vistas of bright things, to make it seem a joyous home.many flowers, open windows, and little vistas of bright things, to make it seem a joyous home.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,practice_block,data/stimuli_toy_x_1/aoi_stimuli_images_toy_x_1/toy_text_3_id8_page_1_toy_aoi.png,toy_text_3_id8_page_1_toy_aoi.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,MultiplEYE PopSci text,Welcome to MultiplEYE!,"The name ""MultiplEYE"" is a wordplay combining ""multilingualism"" or ""multiple languages"" with ""eye"" from ""eye-tracking"". MultiplEYE is a COST Action funded by the European Union. COST Actions are research networks supported by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology or COST for short. As a funding organisation, COST supports our growing network of researchers across Europe and beyond by providing financial assistance for conducting different networking activities. ","These activities include working group meetings, training schools to share skills with younger researchers, and scientific research visits. The project title of the MultiplEYE COST Action is: Enabling multilingual eye-tracking data collection for human and machine language processing research. This means that the MultiplEYE COST Action aims to foster an interdisciplinary network of research groups working on collecting eye-tracking data from reading in multiple languages. ","The goal is to support the development of a large multilingual eye-tracking corpus and enable researchers to collect data by sharing their knowledge between various fields, including linguistics, psychology, speech and language pathology, and computer science. This data collection can then be used to study human language processing from a psycholinguistic perspective as well as to improve and evaluate computational language processing from a machine-learning perspective.","What is ""eye-tracking""?","Eye tracking is the process of measuring the point of gaze - where you are looking - and the movements of the eyes between fixed points of gaze. The device used to measure the eye positions and eye movements is called an eye tracker. It consists of an infrared camera, using a light frequency that does not bother or hurt the human eye. ","With the help of image recognition algorithms, the eye tracker can estimate gaze points very accurately by knowing the position of the head and eyes, the distance to the screen a participant is looking at and the eye tracker's position. Eye-tracking is a helpful technology for many applications. For example, it can help detect tiredness while driving or it can support applications for screening and training purposes in the medical domain. Eye-tracking is also used in gaming, marketing, and human-computer interaction.",Why is eye-tracking while reading especially interesting for our project?,"As you read these words, the eye tracker follows your eye's movements over the text. This provides information about how long you spend looking at a text, or more specifically, how long you spent on each word, which words you skipped, which words you dwelled on, and whether you had to go back and reread parts of the text to understand it better.","As your brain is simultaneously processing the content of the text, your eye movements reflect a lot of the linguistic and cognitive processing going on almost in real time. Thus, the recorded data is a gold mine of information about how we put together a text's meaning and grammatical structures. It shows which parts of the text we struggle with and which parts are easily readable. It is up to the researchers to later explain which linguistic factors caused which type of eye movements.","The motivation behind MultiplEYE is that eye-tracking data is still sparse, especially for more minor languages. Such extensive data collection is a challenge in terms of developing and agreeing on the experimental design, the complexity, and the types of texts to be read by the participants. Other decisions that seem less relevant but are, in fact, very important include the font type and size the text is presented in, the order of the texts, the experiment procedure, and how the data will be processed. ","Receiving eye-tracking data from many participants, including yourself, by reading texts in many different languages will be a great foundation for our research. It will be the main factor in turning our research network into a successful endeavour. We hope to clear the way for advancing research in various subfields of linguistics by supporting and connecting a large group of researchers. ","The main outcomes of the MultiplEYE Action will be a large dataset containing eye-tracking data in many languages and a platform for new collaborations building on this type of data. If you are reading this text, you are already supporting our cause by allowing us to collect and analyse your eye movements while reading and comprehending language.

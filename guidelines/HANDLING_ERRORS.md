# How to handle common errors

How are errors displayed?
- As soon as you start the experiment, a small window will show with text written in it. See screenshot below

- This text will show many experiment details that are not relevant but also the error message. Oftentimes, the error
messages contain some useful information that can help you debug the issue.



## 1. Error: `No such file or directory`
If this is in the error message, it means that the program cannot find the file specified. This can be due to different reasons.
Some of them you can solve yourself, other not.

Sometimes, it is helpful to click `edit` on the interface and then check again that everything was entered correctly and then
click `run` again. Even if everything was entered correctly previously, sometimes it can help to simply restart the experiment.




- reaction latency: the experiment is designed such that participants cannot just press space right when the screen appears.
If you test the experiment and it does not immediately react to your keypress, this is not an error. If the new screen appears, wait a short moment
  (2 seconds are enough) and then press the key. 

- if an error occurs in a core session before the experiment starts, you cannot restart the experiment.

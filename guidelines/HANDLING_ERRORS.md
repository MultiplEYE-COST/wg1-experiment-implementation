# How to handle common errors

How are errors displayed? (finish this section)
- As soon as you start the experiment, a small window will show up with text written in it. See screenshot below (add screenshot)

- This text will show many experiment details that are not relevant but also the error message. Oftentimes, the error
messages contain some useful information that can help you debug the issue.



## Error: `No such file or directory`
If this is in the error message, it means that the program cannot find the file specified. This can be due to different reasons.
Some of them you can solve yourself, others not.

Sometimes, it is helpful to click `edit` on the interface and then check again that everything was entered correctly and then
click `run` again. Even if everything was entered correctly previously, sometimes it can help to simply restart the experiment.



## Image is blurry
If your presentation PC is a windows machine it is possible that you have to adjust the display settings like in the screenshot below.
Make sure that you select the display that you will run the experiment on! And then adjust the scaling to 100%.

Another reason for blurry images is that the images were not adjusted to the resolution and size of your display.
Please read the MultiplEYE guidelines on how to create the images adjusted to your display.


## Other Errors (will be updated soon)
- reaction latency: the experiment is designed such that participants cannot just press space right when the screen appears.
If you test the experiment and it does not immediately react to your keypress, this is not an error. If the new screen appears, wait a short moment
  (2 seconds are enough) and then press the key.
